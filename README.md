## 📌 Swagger
It is an open source application designed to assist developers in the processes of defining, creating, documenting and consuming REST APIs. In essence, Swagger aims to establish standards for integrations of this type, detailing the essential resources of an API, such as endpoints, input data, output data, HTTP codes and authentication methods, among others. Swagger significantly simplifies API development by specifying standards and providing the tools necessary to create secure, high-performance, and scalable APIs.
